git init
initialized git in that folder

git status
here we can see the status of the folder

git add -A
adding all files to staging area

git commit -m "full folder commiting first time"
commiting to local repository

then we want to create a new repository in github account and copy the path of that repository and
git remote add mearn https://github.com/avinashofficialpdm/meanStackWorks.git

git push -u mearn master - mearn is just a name. -u is only using first time in pushing to that repository
